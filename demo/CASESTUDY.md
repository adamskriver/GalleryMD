# Running GalleryMD as a Persistent Docker Service

This case study demonstrates how to run the GalleryMD application in a Docker container on Windows, mounting your local Documents folder and ensuring the service runs independently of your terminal window.

## Steps

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t gallerymd .
   ```

2. **Run the container in detached mode with auto-restart and volume mount:**
   ```sh
   docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 3003:3003 -v "C:\Users\adam\OneDrive\Documents:/app/docs" gallerymd
   ```

   - `-d`: Detached mode (runs in background)
   - `--restart unless-stopped`: Auto-restart unless stopped manually
   - `-p 3003:3003`: Maps port 3003 from container to host
   - `-v "C:\Users\adam\OneDrive\Documents:/app/docs"`: Mounts your Documents folder into the container at `/app/docs`
   - `gallerymd`: The image name

3. **Access the app:**
   - Open your browser to [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)

4. **Notes:**
   - The container will keep running even if you close the terminal or restart Docker Desktop.
   - Make sure Docker Desktop has access to your C: drive (see Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources > File Sharing).
   - Your Markdown files and images in `C:\Users\adam\OneDrive\Documents` will be available to the app inside the container.
